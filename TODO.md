# TODO

- Handle template

- registerName in DomyHelper
- Give access to helpers in compositionAPI
- Access to reactive in DomySpecialHelper (or maybe not because we can make it globally accessible and not adding it to DomyHelper as well)
- Make test for composition API and handle target for composition api (setTarget or .config().mount())
- Separate reactive, utils and types in other packages
- script auto build, release ...

- Collapse, anchor, intersect, mutation, persist (localStorage), i18n, router plugins
