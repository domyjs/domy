# d-scope

The `d-scope` directive in DOMY allows you to **create a reactive data object** that is scoped to the current DOM element and its children. This scoped reactivity means variables defined here will only be available within the specific subtree.

This is useful for isolating state in a portion of the DOM without polluting the global state.

## Syntax

```html
<div d-scope="{ count: 0 }">
  <button @click="count++">+</button>
  <span>{{ count }}</span>
</div>
```

## Example

<Demo
  code={`
    <div d-scope="{ count: 0 }">
      <button @click="count++">+</button>
      <span>{{ count }}</span>
    </div>
  `}
/>
