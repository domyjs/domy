# `d-html`

The `d-html` directive in DOMY.js dynamically sets the `innerHTML` of an element based on a reactive expression. This allows you to inject raw HTML content directly into an element when the evaluated expression changes.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This directive injects raw HTML and should **not** be used with untrusted content to avoid XSS vulnerabilities.

## Syntax

```html
<div d-html="expression"></div>
```

- `expression`: A JavaScript expression evaluated within the component’s scope that returns a string of HTML.

## Behavior

- The content inside the element is **completely replaced** whenever the expression changes.
- You can use it to insert custom markup, including other HTML tags, from a reactive value.
- Unlike `d-text`, it does not escape HTML.

## Example

```html
<div d-html="content"></div>
```

```js
const content = signal('<strong>Hello World!</strong>');
```

This will render:

```html
<div><strong>Hello World!</strong></div>
```

## Usage Notes

- Make sure the data you inject is **safe and sanitized** if it originates from user input.
- It is recommended to use `d-text` if you do **not** want to inject raw HTML.
