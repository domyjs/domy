# d-setup

The `d-setup` directive in DOMY allows you to **execute JavaScript code or a function** when an element is initialized by DOMY for the first time.

This is useful for setting up logic that only needs to run once, such as initial DOM manipulations, logging, or variable initialization.

## Syntax

```html
<div d-setup="console.log('My div is rendering')">...</div>
```

You can also run a function defined in your scope:

```html
<div d-setup="initializeDiv">...</div>
```

If `initializeDiv` is a function in your scope, it will be called when the element is initialized.

## Example

```html
<div d-setup="$el.textContent = 'Hello'"></div>
```

<Demo code={`<div d-setup="$el.textContent = 'Hello'"></div>`} />
