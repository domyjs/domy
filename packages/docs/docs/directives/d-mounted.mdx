# d-mounted

The `d-mounted` directive in DOMY allows you to **run JavaScript code or a function once the element and all its children are fully mounted in the DOM**. This is especially useful when you need to access references (`d-ref`) or ensure that the layout is complete before executing logic.

## Syntax

```html
<div d-mounted="expression"></div>
```

- The `expression` can be any JavaScript code or a function call.
- It is executed once, when the element and its children are mounted.

## Example

```html
<div d-mounted="$refs.text.textContent = 'Hello DOMY!'">
  <div d-ref="text"></div>
</div>
```

<Demo
  code={`
  <div d-mounted="$refs.text.textContent = 'Hello DOMY!'">
    <div d-ref="text"></div>
  </div>
  `}
/>
