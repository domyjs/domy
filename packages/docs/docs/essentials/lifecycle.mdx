# Lifecycle

DOMY provides lifecycle hooks that allow developers to execute logic at different stages of a componentâ€™s lifecycle. These hooks are useful for **initialization, mounting, cleanup, and unmounting processes**.

## Available Lifecycle Hooks

### **onSetuped**

Triggered after the component has completed its setup phase. Mean it went through the whole setup function.

```js
const { onSetuped } = DOMY;

onSetuped(() => {
  console.log('Component setup complete!');
});
```

### **onMounted**

Executed once the component is fully mounted in the DOM. Really usefull to access `refs`.

```js
const { onMounted, useRefs } = DOMY;

const refs = useRefs();

onMounted(() => {
  refs.input.focus();
});
```

### **onBeforeUnmount**

Runs just before the component is unmounted, allowing cleanup operations. For example cleaning `interval`.

```js
const { onBeforeUnmount } = DOMY;

let intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Updating data...');
}, 1000);

onBeforeUnmount(() => {
  clearInterval(intervalId);
});
```

### **onUnmounted**

Triggered after the component has been fully removed from the DOM.

```js
const { onUnmounted } = DOMY;

onUnmounted(() => {
  console.log('Component fully unmounted, resources freed.');
});
```
